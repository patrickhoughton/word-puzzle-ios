# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-27)

**Core value:** Endless, fresh word puzzles that generate algorithmically from a local dictionary — no internet, no content team, no ongoing maintenance.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — persistence-entitlements

## Current Position

Phase: 3
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-08-29

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 5-phase structure derived from requirements; word engine first because generator architecture is expensive to change after game logic is built on top of it
- [Phase 01-word-engine-puzzle-generation]: Set<String>.filter returns Set — convert to Array before assigning to Puzzle.validWords ([String])
- [Phase 01-word-engine-puzzle-generation]: @Suite(.serialized) on test suites that load word lists prevents parallel load memory pressure in Simulator
- [Phase 01-word-engine-puzzle-generation]: Simulator target: iPhone 17 (Xcode 26/iOS 26.5 has no iPhone 16 simulator)
- [Phase 02-persistence-entitlements]: PersistenceStore API frozen: makeContainer(inMemory:url:), record(score:wordsFoundCount:date:), puzzlesPlayedToday(now:), totalGamesPlayed(), bestScore(), totalWordsFound() — plans 02-03/02-05 depend on these exact signatures
- [Phase 02-persistence-entitlements]: Daily streak (RET-01) is derived at read time from GameRecord.date over a bounded 400-day window, not stored as a counter, with grace-day semantics (survives one missed day before playing)
- [Phase 02]: EntitlementStore derives isPremium exclusively from Transaction.currentEntitlements (no UserDefaults/@AppStorage flag), with purchaseUnlimited() and restore() via AppStore.sync() forming the frozen API for Phase 4's paywall
- [Phase 02-05]: Transaction.currentEntitlements is scoped to the signed-in sandbox/production Apple ID account, not local device state — a fresh reinstall on an account with a prior purchase shows isPremium=true immediately, before Restore is tapped. This is correct MON-04 behavior, not a bug; relevant for Phase 4 paywall design/QA.
- [Phase 02-05]: Reset the WordPuzzle.xcscheme Run StoreKit Configuration back to WordPuzzle.storekit after the manual sandbox test (it was set to None for that test per the plan's Step B) so Phase 3/4 local dev is not left pointed at the real sandbox.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- 02-04: EntitlementStoreTests — 3/5 tests (purchase/restore/clear) fail on this dev machine with SKInternalErrorDomain Code=3 / "notEntitled". Developer Mode was enabled and the Mac was fully rebooted; failures persist identically (CLI and Xcode GUI, both against Simulator). Root cause unresolved — likely an Xcode 26.6/iOS 26.5 Simulator SKTestSession bug, not a code defect (physical-device run gets further with a different error). Deferred to plan 02-05's real sandbox purchase test as the authoritative MON-02/MON-03 proof. See 02-04-SUMMARY.md Issues Encountered for full diagnosis.
